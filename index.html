    <div class="intro">
      Musuan also known as Calayo, is a volcano found in Maramag, Bukidnon, in Mindanao. The entire countryside is visible at the peak of Musuan since it is an isolated volcano located in a flat farmland. It became a popular destination for tourists, students, and teachers because of its closeness to the university and town. So most people visit it for relaxation, sight-seeing, and a spot for studying or research.

            Mount Musuan is a continental volcano. From its position, it is evident that it is a volcano found on land since Musuan is above sea level.
          </div>
          <div>
            Mount Musuan has an elevation of six hundred forty-six (646) meters or two thousand one hundred and nineteen (2119) feet. It is taller than the 3rd tallest building in the world -- the Shanghai Tower in China which only stands at 632 meters!

            Musuan Volcano is a 'lava dome' volcano (forming like a hill caused by lava flows) and a 'tuff cone' volcano (volcanoes generally small in size; created in an explosion when there's an interaction between magma and water). 
          </div>
          <div class="fT22">
            The structure of Musuan Volcano is similar to a "salakot" (a cone-shaped farmers' hat).

      <div class="funFTitle">THE LEGEND OF MUSUAN PEAK</div>
      <div class="funFText">
        Did you know that there is a legend about Musuan Peak? It was said that in the same place where this volcano is found, two lovers committed suicide. The place where they were buried rose, resulting in the appearance of Musuan on this day. After that, a foreigner went to this place together with the natives. Upon arriving at the top of the volcano, the foreigner was mesmerized by the beauty of the view since you will be able to see the whole countryside due to the position of Musuan. He then exclaimed, “the most one.” However, the natives found it hard to understand and pronounce what the foreigner said, so they thought of it as “mus-wan.” Afterward, it became the name of the peak that we call today, Musuan.

            1886-1887 Eruption
          </div>
          <div class="recent1desc">
            According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the last eruption of Musuan Volcano was in 1866 and 1867. But as of 2020, they removed it due to uncertainty about those events regarding its geographic description that does not match. There was a report from Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program that it was possibly a phreatic eruption. (Occurs when surface water creates contact with magma and no new magma is released). Musuan Volcano was expected to erupt four years before the visit of the Jesuit priest happened in 1891. But he said he no longer can inspect the volcano closer due to its solfataric activity.

      <div class="visitMText">
        <div class="vmT1">
          Relating to the legend of the Musuan Peak, it is a place you should visit, mainly because of the satisfaction you'll get once you see it in person and the time you reach its peak. Many road trippers stop by to capture the breathtaking appearance of Musuan.
        </div>
        <div class="vmT2">
          Based on what was indicated earlier, most people don't think that Musuan is an active volcano because of the absence of an indication that it has the ability to erupt at any point. It is why many locals or foreigners visit Musuan for hiking or picnic. There are some other activities nearby that you may do aside from what was said. There is also a Zoological and Botanical Garden that you may visit.

        There are two ways for you to climb to the top. The first one is going to the main road which brings a calmer or more relaxing way to climb the peak. You may go there with the use of your bike as well. The second way is you may hike with the use of shortcuts. If you want an intense hike, you may do the second way, and you'll reach the peak in more or less 30 minutes. The moment you climb to the top of Musuan, you'll begin to observe the magnificent view of nature. It is recommendable to have a morning walk there to see the sunrise and feel the freshness of the air. There are available cottages too where you can rest, eat, or sit.

It made them realize how fascinating nature is, and its beauty impressed their hearts and minds. Therefore, Musuan really holds its concept in the legend being the “most one.”
